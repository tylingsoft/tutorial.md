# Paragraphs

A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated by one or more blank lines. 

A blank line is any line that looks like a blank line — a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered blank.

Normal paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs.
